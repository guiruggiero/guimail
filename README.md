# üìß GuiMail

An intelligent email processing AI agent that automatically extracts calendar event information from emails and replies with iCal invitations. Forward an email about a meeting, dinner, or any event (in-person or virtual) to GuiMail, and it'll send back a calendar invite you can add with one click.

### ‚ú® Features

#### AI-powered event extraction
- Gemini Pro model through Gemini API integration for accurate event parsing
- Multi-language support with smart timezone detection
- Confidence scoring to ensure reliable event extraction
- Structured JSON output with event details, including physical location or virtual meeting/broadcast link

#### Smart email and calendar integration
- Automatic iCal invitation generation with proper formatting
- Email threading support to maintain conversation context
- Timezone inference based on email language and explicit mentions
- Handles various date/time formats including relative dates ("tomorrow", "next Friday")

#### Security & reliability
- Email size validation and allowlist-based sender authentication
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Error handling, tracking, and logging

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

#### Cloudflare Email Worker (`worker/`)
- Receives incoming emails
- Enforces sender allowlist and size limits
- Forwards processed emails to Firebase Cloud Function
- Handles email replies back to the original sender

#### Firebase Cloud Function (`functions/`)
- Processes email content using Gemini API
- Extracts structured event data with confidence scoring
- Generates iCal invitations using industry-standard formatting
- Composes and sends reply emails with calendar attachments

- Firebase CLI
- Cloudflare account with Email Workers
- Gemini API key
- Sentry DSN key
