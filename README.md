# 📧 GuiMail

An intelligent multi-purpose email processing AI agent. Forward any email to GuiMail and it will automatically:

- 📅 **Extract calendar events** - Get iCal invitations for meetings, appointments, or any event (in-person or virtual) and add to your calendar with one tap/click
- 📝 **Summarize content** - Receive concise summaries of long emails, newsletters, and threads
- 💰 **Track expenses** - Automatically add credit card statement balances to a budget spreadsheet

Simply forward an email, and GuiMail intelligently chooses the right action based on the content. No manual configuration needed.

### ✨ Features

- **Calendar event extraction** with smart timezone detection, handling of relative dates ("tomorrow", "next Friday"), and confidence scoring
- **iCal invitation** generation with proper **email threading**
- **Email summarization** for quick insights from lengthy content
- **Budget tracking** with Google Sheets
- **Multi-tool AI agent** using Gemini Pro model through the Gemini API with **extensible architecture** for easy addition of new features
- Allowlist-based **sender authentication** and **email size validation**
- **Automatic retry logic** with exponential backoff
- **Error tracking** and logging

### 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

#### Cloudflare Email Worker (`worker/`)
- Receives incoming emails via Cloudflare Email Routing
- Enforces sender allowlist and size limits
- Forwards processed emails to Firebase Cloud Function
- Handles email replies back to the original sender

#### Firebase Cloud Function (`functions/`)
- Processes email content using Gemini API with tool calling
- Automatically chooses tool for calendar event, summarization, or budget tracking
- Extracts structured data with validation and confidence scoring
- Generates iCal invitations using industry-standard formatting
- Updates Google Sheets via API
- Composes and sends reply emails with proper threading
